  Knight Custom Electronics upholds a strict 100% NO LANDFILL Policy. From
  office trash to electronics, everything we put out is reused or recycled. This
  is our promise to you. Here at Knight Custom Electronics we have a high
  standard when it comes to caring for our environment and giving back to our
  beloved community. We continue to support green practices and the recycling of
  all electronic equipment by offering free recycling services. Although most
  electronics are free to recycle through us we do ask for a small $5-10
  donation to help cover our recycling costs. Knight Custom Electronics has
  teamed up with Electronic Recyclers International, Inc. (ERI) to insure that
  our high recycling standards are met and exceeded. We have found ERI to have
  the most responsible recycling services available in Colorado, as they support
  our 100% NO LANDFILL Policy.
