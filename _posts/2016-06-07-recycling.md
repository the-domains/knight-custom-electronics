  Knight Custom Electronics upholds a strict 100% NO LANDFILL policy, when it
  comes to trash and discarded items. This means that all the trash we produce,
  from our office to our job sites, gets recycled, renewed or reused. We have a
  high standard when it comes to caring for our environment and giving back to
  our beautiful community, which is why we support green practices and the
  recycling of electronic equipment by offering recycling services for all
  electronics. While we work hard to offer this service for mostly free, we do
  have pricing for some electronics that have a high recycling expense, we also
  accept donations to help us cover the cost.
