  Knight Custom Electronics upholds a strict 100% NO LANDFILL Policy. This means
  that all the trash we produce, from our office to our job sites, gets
  recycled, renewed or reused. We have a high standard when it comes to caring
  for our environment and giving back to our beloved community, which is why we
  support green practices and the recycling of all electronic equipment by
  offering free recycling services. Knight Custom Electronics has teamed up with
  Electronic Recyclers International, Inc. (ERI) to insure that our high
  standards are met and exceeded. We have found ERI to have the most responsible
  recycling services available in Colorado, as they support our 100% NO LANDFILL
  Policy. While we work hard to offer this free service, we also accept
  donations to help us cover the high recycling costs.
