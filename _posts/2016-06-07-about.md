Brian Allen has worked for Knight Custom Electronics as Salida's only electronics expert for eight years before partnering with his wife, Tayler Allen to purchase the business in April of 2015\. Together, Brian and Tayler provide a wide range of technological services in the electronics and technology fields. Brian's mission is to deliver the highest quality results at a fair price, to get the job done your way, the right way and on time. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bb3c8b64957312cecfa966f48a24a9f4/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3333&cropwidth=2223&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F22144d5a-4a84-4e2d-8663-962703d087c7.jpg&x=0&y=0)

Aside from sound and technology Brian and Tayler are passionate about their family. Their oldest daughter, Aurora, who is about to begin the 2nd grade is an avid skier. Spending three years at Monarch Mountain and two years at Keystone Mountain has transformed Aurora into an experienced sportsman. Novali, soon begins her first year at Longfellow Elementary. She has developed a love for ballet. Dancing in her first big performance last year as Princess Elsa, lit a fire of passion in her that cannot be ignored. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c69ee01f-97e1-41e4-888e-a23833a08e0e.jpg)

Brian and Tayler don't only love their girls at home, they love their girls abroad as well. Meet Adjouavi and Sessere, who're supported by the Allen family through [Compassion International's][0] outreach program. Adjouavi turned 10 last January and Sessere will be 7 in November. They're hard working young ladies who receive high marks in their schooling program. It is Brian and Tayler's desire to support more children in poverty as Knight Custom Electronics grows stronger as a company.
